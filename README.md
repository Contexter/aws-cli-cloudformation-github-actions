# Get to know - the AWS CLI, CloudFormation, Git, and GitHub Actions

Welcome to **Get to know AWS CLI, CloudFormation, Git, and GitHub Actions with Shell Scripting**—a friendly guide to automating, managing, and deploying AWS infrastructure using a powerful combination of tools and practices. This repository will take you from the basics to advanced techniques, providing you with a robust foundation in both cloud infrastructure management and modern CI/CD pipelines.

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is intended for developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who are:

- **New to AWS and Automation**: If you're just beginning your journey with AWS and want to learn how to automate your cloud infrastructure, this guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.
- **Experienced in AWS**: If you already have experience with AWS but want to master Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CloudFormation and CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, this guide will deepen your knowledge.
- **Looking to Implement CI/CD**: If you aim to integrate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) into your workflow, this guide will teach you how to set up GitHub Actions to automate testing, validation, and deployment.

## What You Will Learn

This guide is structured as a series of 15 tutorials, each designed to build upon the knowledge from the previous ones. By the end of this guide, you will have mastered:

1. **Git and GitHub Basics**: Learn the fundamentals of version control with Git and how to use GitHub for collaborative development.
2. **GitHub Actions**: Set up and customize GitHub Actions to automate tasks, including building custom actions and creating CI pipelines.
3. **AWS CLI Essentials**: Learn about the AWS CLI to manage AWS resources directly from the command line.
4. **CloudFormation Fundamentals**: Understand how to write, deploy, and manage CloudFormation templates for Infrastructure as Code.
5. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Combine what you've learned to build a complete CI/CD pipeline that automates AWS infrastructure deployment.
6. **Advanced CloudFormation and AWS Practices**: Explore advanced features like nested stacks, security best practices, and disaster recovery automation.

# Automating Disaster Recovery with GitHub Actions and CloudFormation

## Overview

Disaster recovery is a critical component of any robust IT infrastructure. It ensures that your systems can be quickly restored to a working state in the event of a failure. By using AWS CloudFormation and GitHub Actions, you can automate your disaster recovery processes, making it easier to restore infrastructure and applications.

In this tutorial, you will:

1. **Understand Disaster Recovery Concepts**: Learn about different disaster recovery strategies and their importance.
2. **Set Up a Backup Strategy**: Use CloudFormation to back up critical infrastructure components.
3. **Automate Disaster Recovery with GitHub Actions**: Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the recovery process.
4. **Test Your Disaster Recovery Plan**: Regularly test your disaster recovery plan to ensure it works as expected.

## 1. Understanding Disaster Recovery Concepts

### Step 1: Disaster Recovery Strategies

There are several disaster recovery strategies, ranging from simple backups to fully automated failovers:

- **Backup and Restore**: Regularly back up data and infrastructure configurations. Recovery involves restoring from these backups.
- **Pilot Light**: A minimal version of your environment is always running in the cloud, ready to scale up if needed.
- **Warm Standby**: A scaled-down but fully functional version of your environment runs continuously. In a disaster, you scale it up to handle production loads.
- **Multi-Site Active/Active**: Fully functional environments run in parallel in different locations. Traffic is load balanced between them, and they can take over from each other instantly.

### Step 2: Choosing a Strategy

The appropriate disaster recovery strategy depends on your organization’s needs, budget, and the criticality of your systems. For this tutorial, we will focus on the **Backup and Restore** strategy, which is suitable for most applications.

## 2. Setting Up a Backup Strategy with CloudFormation

### Step 1: Back Up S3 Buckets

You can use CloudFormation to back up your S3 buckets by copying data to another bucket or another region:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: Backup S3 bucket data to another region

Resources:
  S3BackupBucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-backup-bucket

  S3BackupBucketPolicy:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::BucketPolicy'
    Properties:
      Bucket: !Ref S3BackupBucket
      PolicyDocument:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Action:
              - 's3:PutObject'
              - 's3:PutObjectAcl'
            Resource: !Sub 'arn:aws:s3:::${S3BackupBucket}/*'

Outputs:
  BackupBucketName:
    Value: !Ref S3BackupBucket
```

### Step 2: Back Up RDS Databases

For RDS databases, you can automate backups using snapshots:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: Automate RDS snapshots

Resources:
  MyDBSnapshot:
    Type: 'AWS::RDS::DBSnapshot'
    Properties:
      DBInstanceIdentifier: my-db-instance
      DBSnapshotIdentifier: my-db-snapshot

Outputs:
  SnapshotIdentifier:
    Value: !Ref MyDBSnapshot
```

### Step 3: Create an AMI for EC2 Instances

You can back up EC2 instances by creating AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) regularly:

```bash
aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-0123456789abcdef0 --name "Backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

This command creates an AMI of the specified instance, which can be used to restore the instance in case of a failure.

## 3. Automating Disaster Recovery with GitHub Actions

### Step 1: Create a Disaster Recovery Workflow

You can automate the execution of your disaster recovery plan using GitHub Actions. Create a workflow file named `disaster-recovery.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory:

```yaml
name: Disaster Recovery

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  restore:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-west-2

    - name: Restore S3 bucket
      run: |
        aws s3 sync s3://my-backup-bucket s3://my-original-bucket

    - name: Restore RDS from snapshot
      run: |
        aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
          --db-instance-identifier my-restored-db \
          --db-snapshot-identifier my-db-snapshot

    - name: Launch EC2 instance from AMI
      run: |
        aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0123456789abcdef0 --instance-type t2.micro
```

This workflow performs the following actions:

- **Restores** S3 bucket data from the backup bucket.
- **Restores** an RDS instance from a snapshot.
- **Launches** a new EC2 instance from an AMI.

### Step 2: Trigger the Disaster Recovery Workflow

You can trigger this workflow manually from the GitHub Actions interface or set it to run on a schedule:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *' # Runs daily at 2:00 AM UTC
```

## 4. Testing Your Disaster Recovery Plan

### Step 1: Regularly Test Your Recovery Process

Testing is a crucial part of any disaster recovery plan. Regularly test your recovery process to ensure that it works as expected:

1. Simulate a failure by intentionally deleting a resource (e.g., an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance).
2. Trigger the disaster recovery workflow.
3. Verify that the resource is restored correctly.

### Step 2: Review and Update the Plan

Regularly review and update your disaster recovery plan to address changes in your infrastructure or requirements. Ensure that new resources are included in the backup and recovery process.

## Conclusion

You’ve now learned how to automate disaster recovery processes using AWS CloudFormation and GitHub Actions. By regularly backing up your resources and automating recovery tasks, you can minimize downtime and ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster. In the next tutorial, you’ll learn about scaling and optimizing your infrastructure with AWS.
